Okay, maybe hate is a strong word and I know what youâ€™re thinking, but hear me out. Without `man` pages of course most of us would be lost and confused; just fumbling our way around the command-line. Although `man` pages are such a great resource they can however be quite extensive and hard to find what you need quickly. If that sounds like you then let me introduce you to `tldr` pages. [TLDR](https://tldr.sh/) is a tool that attempts to simplify the beloved man pages with practical examples. Look at an example below.

So much simpler and cleaner right? I thought so too! Coolest part is they also have a web version - [https://tldr.ostera.io/](https://tldr.ostera.io/)

## Installation
Their most mature client is the Node.js one, which you can easily install from npm:

`npm install -g tldr`
