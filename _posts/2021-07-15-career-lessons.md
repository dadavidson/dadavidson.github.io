description: Just a few things I've learned along the way
---

*Over my career, I’ve kept a short, private list of the most important lessons I’ve learned, usually the hard way. In hopes that others might avoid the mistakes I've made, I've decided to publish and maintain that list here.*

1. K.I.S.S. - "Keep it super simple"
2. Keep your distance from people who will never admit they are wrong.
3. Sit with warriors. The conversation is different.
4. Don't care about who's doing better than you. Be better than yourself yesterday.
5. Build things with growth and modularity in mind.
6. Nobody is irreplaceable.
7. Have a big vision, but execute incrementally.
8. Encourage and lift up others selflessly.
9. Be valuable and create value.
10. Never give up!
