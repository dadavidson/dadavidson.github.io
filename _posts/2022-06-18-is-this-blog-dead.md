description: A short update with what's going on in life and my ideas for the blog
---

Hello all,

It's 11:00 pm and I'm writing from the comfort of my bed as everyone else is asleep right about now.

I know what you're thinking. No new posts for a while now. What is going on?!

Trust me I feel horrible about it.

The truth is I started a [new role](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danieldav_networkengineer-thankyou-team-activity-6912060514407702529-wnCX?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) a couple of months ago and I don’t have much time to blog as much as I'd like (I still kind of don’t).

Few things I want to do / blog about in the next months:

- Participate in Hackathons or Wargames or possibly even CTFs
- Get done with CompTIA A+, Project+, and Network+ sometime before 2023
- Writeups for Cisco CCNA labs (hopefully create my own lab exercises using Cisco Packet Tracer)
- Blog about Python network automation basics and exploitation techniques
