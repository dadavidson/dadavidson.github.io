[CyberSoc Detective CTF](https://ctf.cybersoc.wales/) is a platform that contains many OSINT-based challenges. It was created by the [Cyber Society at Cardiff University](https://cybersoc.wales/about).

In this post, I will be covering my write-up for the Life Online challenges. 

*NOTE: I do not have the flag to the challenge **leaveamessage**. In fact, at the time of this writing, I found out from the creators via their Facebook group that the challenge was broken and had several inconsistencies making the challenge not completable. They are currently working on a fix.*

We're given Mr. James Markson's twitter profile so let's see if we can deduce from his profile his political affiliation.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0jcbH1p.png)

After searching down his feed we discover him retweeting something from Barrack Obama (Democrat).

![](https://i.imgur.com/kty7ND7.png)

Adding to that, we see him retweeting Ron Wyden essentially expressing his disdain for Donald Trump (Republican).

![](https://i.imgur.com/tFgFJfH.png)

Suffice to say James is a Democrat.

Looking back at James's Twitter account, we see some strange almost cipher-like wording.

`Born in ///purple.pulse.force, raised in ///push.asking.barn.`

![](https://i.imgur.com/01eQtt1.png)

After browsing through more of his tweets, James references an app called [what3words](https://what3words.com/about).

![](https://i.imgur.com/gtXLf3s.png)

Essentially the tool allows people to use **3 words** to encode a person's precise location on their online map tool. Let's put in the phrases found on his Twitter before.

Born in...**Bristol**

Raised in...**York**

Amongst two tweets I was able to discern the answer to this challenge. For one, the train James usually boards on his way home is pretty consistently late. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2OZ4pvw.png)

Secondly, he tweets a picture of the train station he departed from.

![](https://i.imgur.com/VmAvAUS.png)

Upon reverse image searched the picture of the train station I discovered the name of the train station to **Cardiff Central Railway Station** which is located obviously in **Cardiff**.

Amongst James's **Twitter likes** that he liked a tweet from an associate named Sarah Luxton(*Twitter: @sarah_luxton*). This tweet details a picture of what perceives to be her upcoming vacation in two weeks and the location thereof.

![](https://i.imgur.com/eXX9O5W.png)

Again I did a reverse image search in Google.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xofXK0p.png)

The location is **Perth**.

Inspecting Sarah's profile she mentions, "Buster favorite place" and then provides some latitude longitude coordinates. I'm assuming "Buster" is her dog name.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WzBxQpf.png)

Cross-referencing the coordinates with Google Maps, we have a pin on a bridge at 2 Bridge Street, Brecon LD3 9AH, UK

![](https://i.imgur.com/UnWqgVm.png)

Diving into Google Streetview...

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rdk5UJi.jpg)

The answer for this challenge is simply **Brecon**.

Looking back again at James Markson's Twitter likes I stumbled upon a bold but stupid tweet by another associate by the name of George Watson(*Twitter: @GeorgeWatson428*). He thinks his password is "...secure and unbreakable!"

![](https://i.imgur.com/zir6HE8.png)

His password is encoded in base64 which can easily be decrypted using the following command:

```console
# echo aW1hbWF6aW5nMTIz | base64 --decode

On Georgeâ€™s Twitter profile, we find another target named Pearce Ress(*Twitter: @PearceRess*). Pearce casually mentions George left his debit card laying around and states he left George's credit card on his desk. Also provides a proof photo of George Watson's desk.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6DnVZ2H.png)

I'm still puzzled by what the numbers mean but the answer was **Brown Silver**.

Circling back to Mr. James Markson's Twitter I noticed a small piece of text slipping out from behind his profile photo.

In one of his tweets, James mentions how it was a tough 8 hour day of work. The timestamp on the post reflects 4:02 PM, which subtracting 8 hours from then means he started work at 8:00 am.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zqA6972.png)

Twitter shows the tweet timestamps based upon the viewer's location or the original poster's location. Converting the timestamps from the US to UK time resulted in 14:00.

This one was really easy as I had already seen through my enumeration of each target the text message conversation referencing a meme and a Software Access Code.

Answer was **CTF3404X71**

Pearce tweets he's hosting a party tagging @sarah_luxton @Sophjones77 @GeorgeWatson248 @jenmp7

I used a combination of tools and compared the results to see if anything matched.

[Traveline](https://www.traveline.info) returned the following:

I also used Google Maps and selected the Public Transport option:

Looks like the best route is bus 58.
