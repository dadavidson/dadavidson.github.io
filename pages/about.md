# About this site

> *"How great is the sum of thy thoughts? If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand."*

This site serves as an external memory source to note and share my experiences. It is my intention through this endeavor to document resources and findings that I have to found to be critical to my progress as a Cybersecurity profressional. I hope, not only will this be a learning experience for myself, but a resource for others as well.
